# Observability

* Google has released in a book in 2016 about how google runs production called it as [Site Reliability Engineering](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Site_Reliability_Engineering/tYrPCwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)
* [Site Reliability Engineering Overview](https://directdevops.blog/2019/10/22/site-reliability-engineering-overview/)
* [Golden Signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/)
* SLIs, SLOs and SLAs

# Making Applications Observable

* Getting **Metrics** from application into Prometheus
  * Exporters: To get metrics from well known servers
  * In the application code expose prometheus metrics endpoint

* **Logs:**
  * Any enterprise apps generate logs
  * If the logs are written to files use log agents (fluentd)
  * Developers can code to directly send logs to centralized log server
* **Traces:**
  * For sending traces of your application to almost any tool there is a standard called as [open telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
