# Config Maps and Secrets

* [Refer Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) for official docs of config maps
* [Refer Here](https://github.com/rithwiksrivastav4/kubernetes/commit/a8d741c80016e6522506b9892cbe8ac28e6604b3) for the changes done to read the values from config maps into pods

* Config maps gives us flexibility to separate configuration from Pod

* The sensitive information is still in plain text, To solve this Secrets for k8s gives an

* base64encoding based approach to store sensitive information

* [Refer Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for official docs of secrets
* [Refer Here](https://github.com/rithwiksrivastav4/kubernetes/commit/30689a3405ea683387f084601a84529924a26d0e) for changes done to use secrets

* The production approach for storing sensitive information will be
  * Use an external secrets manager like azure key vault, aws secrets manager, gcp secrets manager or hashicorp vault

  * Use secrets CSI Driver of a vendor to get the sensitive information into k8s as storage

## Health Checks or Probes in Kubernetes

* Kubernetes utilizes three types of probes to monitor the health and readiness of containers within pods: liveness probes, readiness probes, and startup probes. Each type serves a distinct purpose in ensuring that applications run smoothly and efficiently.

* In K8s we have 3 types of Probes
  * Liveness Probe:
    * Determines if the container is running or not
    * If Probe fails the container is restarted
    * Purpose: Liveness probes check if a container is still running and functioning correctly. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes considers the container unhealthy and will restart it. This is crucial for applications that may encounter runtime issues or deadlocks.
    * Usage: They are used to manage containers that should be restarted if they fail or become unresponsive. This helps maintain application availability by automatically recovering from failures
  * Readiness Probe
    * Determines if the application is running or not
    * If probe fails, this container will not recieve requests from service
    * Purpose: Readiness probes determine if a container is ready to accept incoming network traffic. A container that passes this probe is considered fully initialized and capable of handling requests. If it fails, Kubernetes removes the container's IP address from the service's list of endpoints, directing traffic to other healthy containers.
    * Usage: These probes are essential for applications that require time to initialize before they can handle requests. They ensure that traffic is only sent to containers that are fully operational, enhancing user experience and system reliability
  * Startup Probe
    * Determines if the container starup is complete or not
    * If this probe fails no further probes are executed
    * Purpose: Startup probes are designed to check whether a container's application has started successfully. They are particularly useful for applications that take longer to start up. Unlike liveness and readiness probes, the outcome of a startup probe does not affect the container's readiness or liveness status until it succeeds.
    * Usage: Startup probes prevent liveness and readiness checks from interfering with the startup process of slow-starting applications, allowing them time to initialize properly without being prematurely restarted.
* In summary, these probes are integral to Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities, ensuring that applications remain available and responsive by managing their lifecycle effectively.
